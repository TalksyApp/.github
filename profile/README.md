# Talksy- Social Media App
A **platform** where conversations flow naturally, connections feel real, and every chat matters. We are not just developing any other chat application; we are eying the revolution that will help like-minded people connect with others.


Its a modern social media application built with the latest web technologies. It is designed to facilitate social interactions, real-time messaging, and content sharing.

It’s simple, fast, and made for people who want to talk, not chase likes.
